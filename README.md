## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the WeatherApp:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WeatherApp.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd WeatherApp

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn: 
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

4. Obtain an API key from a weather data provider such as OpenWeather or WeatherAPI. Create a .env file in the project root and add your API key:
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev

6.Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the WeatherApp.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of the application.
  - `components/`: React components used to build the user interface.
  - `styles/`: CSS or SCSS files for styling the application.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the application.
- `public/`: Static assets and the HTML template.
- `package.json`: Dependencies and project configuration.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration settings.

## Usage
Enter a city name or location in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display weather information for that location.
The application will display the current temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather.
Explore the code to understand how data is fetched from the weather API, and how it is displayed in the UI.
Experiment with the code and make changes to enhance your understanding of React and API handling.
